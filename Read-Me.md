**System Name**
Online radio

**Description**
The present application is a demonstration of the development possibilities with ionic.
In this case Ionic 7 and Angular 16 were used

**Installation**
Ionic is a cross platform tool, that is, it generates native codes for Android (use Android Studio), IOS (use XCode), Web (www) and Electron.

**Use**
Choose your radio station, click play, stop, increase or decrease the volume.

**Contribution**
For the specific case gradle 8 is not compatible with Ionic Capacitor's NativeAudio library.
At the moment I don't have a MacBook, so it wasn't possible to deploy in the Apple environment.

**License**
This app is free to use as a basis for other work.
The radio links may not work in the future as they are free online radio.
